# \_LittleK\_
Welcome! This is the [MCDR](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged) port of the [Teahouse Studio QQ bot](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/bot).

**This plugin is not stable. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

## Commands
| Command | Usage | Note |

| WIP | WIP | WIP |

## FAQ
### Why does all the commands starts with `!!&` instead of normal `!!`?
This is because most of our command name are common, and they're easy to conflict with other plugins. We want to keep it simple (both command and prefix). We _may_ will let you change it in a config file in the future.

### Why did you guys jam all these craps into one single repo?
In the normal and traditional way, they should be splitted into multiple repositories. But considering these functions are all for querying, and bundling them in one package or not don't make a difference anyway, we put them in one repo.

However, every single function is in one file, so now you can just delete what you don't want.

### What does this weird name of the plugin mean???
This name is based on: 

1. The wonderful name of the one and only [\_LittleC\_](https://github.com/XxLittleCxX).
2. The name which is also wonderful of the faithful QQ bot [Xiao Ke](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/bot) (小可，Little Ke).

Now you get it.

### i18n when???
Coming S∞n™.

## To-do
1. Inline commands
2. Changeable prefix
3. i18n support
4. Sync other stuff
